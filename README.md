# The-Sparks-Foundation-GRIP (TASK 1 - Prediction Using Machine Learning)
 # We will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions
 # In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
